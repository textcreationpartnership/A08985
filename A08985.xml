            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <l>he would send meanes unto:</l>
            <l>And those whom famine did oppresse</l>
            <l>found him a friendly foe.</l>
            <l>Nor would he doe a woman wrong,</l>
            <l>but sée her safe conveid:</l>
            <l>He would protect with power strong</l>
            <l>all those who crav'd his ayde.</l>
            <l>The Abbot of Saint Maries then,</l>
            <l>who him undid before:</l>
            <l>Was riding with two hundred men,</l>
            <l>and Gold and Silver store:</l>
            <l>But Robbin Hood upon him set</l>
            <l>with his Couragious Sparkes:</l>
            <l>And all the coyne, perforce did get,</l>
            <l>which was twelve thousand Markes.</l>
            <l>He bound the Abbot to a Trée,</l>
            <l>and would not let him passe.</l>
            <pb facs="tcp:25113:5"/>
            <l>Before that (to his men and he)</l>
            <l>his Lordship had sayd Masse.</l>
            <l>Which being done upon his horse</l>
            <l>he set him fast a stride:</l>
            <l>And with his face towards his ar—</l>
            <l>he forced him to ride.</l>
            <l>His men were faine to be his guide,</l>
            <l>for he rode backward home:</l>
            <l>The Abbot being thus vilifide</l>
            <l>did sorely chafe and fume.</l>
            <l>Thus Robbin Hood did vindicate</l>
            <l>his former wrongs receiv'd:</l>
            <l>For 'twas this covetous Prelate,</l>
            <l>that him of Land bereav'd.</l>
            <l>The Abbot he rode to the King,</l>
            <l>with all the haste he could,</l>
            <l>And to his Grace he every thing,</l>
            <l>exactly did unfold.</l>
            <l>And sayd if that no course were tane,</l>
            <l>(by force or Stratagem)</l>
            <l>To take this Rebell and his traine,</l>
            <l>no man should passe for them.</l>
            <l>The King protested by and by,</l>
            <l>unto the Abbot then,</l>
            <l>That Robbin Hood with spéed should dye,</l>
            <l>with all his merry men.</l>
            <l>But ere the King did any send,</l>
            <l>he did another feate:</l>
            <pb facs="tcp:25113:6"/>
            <l>Which did his Grace much more offend,</l>
            <l>the fact (indéed) was great.</l>
            <l>For in a short time after that,</l>
            <l>the Kings Receivers went.</l>
            <l>Towards London with the Coyne they got,</l>
            <l>for's Highnesse Northerne Rent.</l>
            <l>Bold Robbin Hood and little Iohn,</l>
            <l>with the rest of their Traine:</l>
            <l>(Not dreading Law) set them upon,</l>
            <l>and did their gold obtaine.</l>
            <l>The King much moved at the same,</l>
            <l>(and the Abbots talke also,)</l>
            <l>In this his anger did proclaime,</l>
            <l>(and sent word to and fro:)</l>
            <l>That whoso'ere alive or dead,</l>
            <l>could bring him Robbin Hood,</l>
            <l>Should have one thousand Markes well payd,</l>
            <l>in gold and silver good.</l>
            <l>This promise of the King did make,</l>
            <l>full many yeomen bold,</l>
            <l>Attempt stout Robbin Hood to take,</l>
            <l>with all the force they could:</l>
            <l>But still when any came to him,</l>
            <l>within the gay gréene wood:</l>
            <l>He entertainement gave to them,</l>
            <l>with Venison sat and good.</l>
            <l>And shewd to them such martiall sport,</l>
            <l>with his long bow and Arrow,</l>
            <pb facs="tcp:25113:6"/>
            <l>That they of him did give report,</l>
            <l>how that it was great sorrow,</l>
            <l>That such a worthy man as he,</l>
            <l>should thus be put to shift,</l>
            <l>Being late a Lord of high degrée,</l>
            <l>of living quite bereft.</l>
            <l>The King to take him, more and more,</l>
            <l>sent men of mickle might:</l>
            <l>But he and his still beate them sore,</l>
            <l>and conquered them in fight:</l>
            <l>Or else with love and courtesie,</l>
            <l>to him he won their hearts.</l>
            <l>Thus still he lived by robbery,</l>
            <l>throughout the Northerne parts.</l>
            <l>And all the Country stood in dread,</l>
            <l>of Robbin Hood and's men:</l>
            <l>For stouter Lads ne're liv'd by bread,</l>
            <l>in those dayes nor since then.</l>
            <l>The Abbot (which before I nam'd,)</l>
            <l>sought all the meanes he could,</l>
            <l>To have by force this Rebell tane,</l>
            <l>and his adherents bold.</l>
            <l>Therefore he arm'd five hundred men,</l>
            <l>with furniture compleate:</l>
            <l>But the outlawes slew halfe of them,</l>
            <l>and made the rest retreate.</l>
            <l>The long bow and the arrow kéene,</l>
            <l>they were so us'd unto:</l>
            <pb facs="tcp:25113:7"/>
            <l>That still they kept the Forest gréene,</l>
            <l>in spight o'th' proudest foe.</l>
            <l>Twelve of the Abbots men he tooke,</l>
            <l>who came him to have tane:</l>
            <l>When all the rest the field forsooke,</l>
            <l>these he did entertaine;</l>
            <l>With Banquetting and Merriment,</l>
            <l>and having us'd them well,</l>
            <l>He to their Lord them safely sent,</l>
            <l>and will'd them him to tell:</l>
            <l>That if he would be pleas'd at last</l>
            <l>to beg of our good King;</l>
            <l>That he might pardon what was past,</l>
            <l>and him to favour bring:</l>
            <l>He would surrender backe agen</l>
            <l>the money which before</l>
            <l>Was taken by him and his men,</l>
            <l>from him and many more.</l>
            <l>Poore men might safely passe by him,</l>
            <l>and some that way would chuse,</l>
            <l>For well they knew that to helpe them,</l>
            <l>he evermore did use.</l>
            <l>But where he knew a Miser Rich</l>
            <l>that did the poore oppresse;</l>
            <l>To féele his Coyne his hand did itch</l>
            <l>hée'de have it more or lesse.</l>
            <l>And sometimes when the high-way fayld,</l>

            <l>He and his men have oft assayld</l>
            <l>such rich men in their houses:</l>
            <l>So that through dread of Robbin then,</l>
            <l>and his adventurous Crew:</l>
            <l>The Mizers kept great store of men,</l>
            <l>which else maintayn'd but few.</l>
            <l>King Richard of that name the first,</l>
            <l>Sirnamed Cuer de Lyon,</l>
            <l>Went to defeate the Pagans Curst,</l>
            <l>who kept the coasts of Syon,</l>
            <l>The Bishop of Ely Chancelor</l>
            <l>was left as vice Roy here,</l>
            <l>Who like a potent Emperor,</l>
            <l>did proudly domminere.</l>
            <l>Our Chronicles of him report</l>
            <l>that commonly he rode:</l>
            <l>With a thousand Horse from court to court,</l>
            <l>where he would make abode.</l>
            <l>He riding downe towards the North,</l>
            <l>with his aforesayd traine:</l>
            <l>Robbin and his did issue forth</l>
            <l>them all to entertaine.</l>
            <l>And with the Gallant Gray Goose wing,</l>
            <l>they shewed to them such play,</l>
            <l>That made their horses kickle and fling,</l>
            <l>and downe their Riders Lay.</l>
            <l>Full glad and faine the Bishop was</l>
            <l>for all his thousand men,</l>
            <pb facs="tcp:25113:8"/>
            <l>To séeke what meanes he could to passe,</l>
            <l>from out of Robbins ken.</l>
            <l>Two hundred of his men were kil'd,</l>
            <l>and fourescore horses good;</l>
            <l>Thirty who did as captives yéeld,</l>
            <l>were carryed to the gréene wood:</l>
            <l>Which afterwards were ransomed,</l>
            <l>for twenty Markes a man:</l>
            <l>The rest set spurres to horse and fled,</l>
            <l>to'th towne of Warrington.</l>
            <l>The Bishop sore enraged then,</l>
            <l>did in King Richards name:</l>
            <l>Muster a power of Northerne men,</l>
            <l>these outlawes bold to tame.</l>
            <l>But Robbin with his courtesie,</l>
            <l>so wonne the meaner sort,</l>
            <l>That they were loath on him to try,</l>
            <l>what rigor did import.</l>
            <l>So that bold Robbin and his traine,</l>
            <l>did live unhurt of them:</l>
            <l>Vntill King <hi>Richard</hi> came againe,</l>
            <l>from faire Ierusalem.</l>
            <l>And then the talke of of Robbin Hood,</l>

            <l>His grace admir'd that ith gréene wood,</l>
            <l>he thus continued still.</l>
            <l>So that the country farre and neare,</l>
            <l>did give him great applause:</l>
            <pb facs="tcp:25113:8"/>
            <l>For none of them néede stand in feare,</l>
            <l>but such as broke the lawes.</l>
            <l>He wished well unto the King,</l>
            <l>and prayed still for his health:</l>
            <l>And dever practised any thing,</l>
            <l>against the Common wealth.</l>
            <l>Onely because he was undone,</l>
            <l>by'th' Crewell Clergie then:</l>
            <l>All meanes that he could thinke upon,</l>
            <l>to vexe such kinde of men,</l>
            <l>He enterprized with hatefull spléene,</l>
            <l>in which he was to blame:</l>
            <l>For fault of some to wréeke his téene</l>
            <l>on all that by him came.</l>
            <l>With wealth which he by Robbery got</l>
            <l>eight almes houses he built:</l>
            <l>Thinking thereby to purge the blot,</l>
            <l>of blood which he had spilt:</l>
            <l>Such was their blinde devotion then,</l>
            <l>depending on their workes:</l>
            <l>Which if 'twere true, we Christian men,</l>
            <l>inferiour were to Turkes.</l>
            <l>But to speake true of Robbin Hood,</l>
            <l>and wrong him not a jot:</l>
            <l>He never would shed any mans blood,</l>
            <l>that him invaded not.</l>
            <l>Nor would he iniure husbandmen,</l>

            <pb facs="tcp:25113:9"/>
            <l>For well he knew, were't not for them,</l>

            <l>The King in person with some Lords,</l>
            <l>to Nothingham did Ride,</l>
            <l>To try what Strength and skill affords,</l>
            <l>to Crush these out lawes pride.</l>
            <l>And as he once before had done,</l>
            <l>he did againe proclaime</l>

            <l>While that the King and Lords did stay</l>

            <l>Some of these outlawes fled away</l>
            <l>unto the Scottish King:</l>

            <l>to trust him with his breath.</l>
            <l>His Corpes the Priores of the place,</l>
            <l>(the next day that he dy'd)</l>
            <l>Caused to be hurted (in meane case)</l>
            <l>close by the high way side.</l>
            <l>And over him she caused a stone,</l>
            <l>to be fired on the ground:</l>
            <l>An Epitaph was set thereon,</l>
            <l>wherein his name was found,</l>
            <l>The date o'th yeare and day also,</l>
            <l>shée made to be set there:</l>
            <l>That all who by the way did goe.</l>
            <l>might sée it plaine appeare,</l>
            <l>That such a man as Robbin Hood,</l>
            <l>was buried in that place:</l>
            <l>And how he lived in the gréene wood,</l>
            <l>and Rob'd there for a space.</l>
            <l>It seemes that though the Clergie he,</l>
            <l>had put to mickle woe:</l>
            <l>He should not quite forgotten be,</l>
            <l>although he was their foe.</l>
            <l>This woman though she did him hate,</l>
            <l>yet loved his memory:</l>
            <pb facs="tcp:25113:11"/>
            <l>And thought it wondrous pitty that,</l>
            <l>his fame should with him dye.</l>
            <l>This Epitaph, as Records tell,</l>
            <l>within this hundred yeares,</l>
            <l>By many was discerned well,</l>
            <l>but time all things outweares.</l>
            <l>His followers when he was dead,</l>
            <l>were some received to grace:</l>
            <l>The rest to forraigne Countries fled,</l>
            <l>and left their native place.</l>
            <l>Although his funerall was but meane,</l>
            <l>this woman had in minde:</l>
            <l>Least his fame should be burried cleare,</l>
            <l>from those that came behind.</l>
            <l>For certainely before nor since,</l>
            <l>no man ere vnderstood:</l>
            <l>Vnder the reigne of any Prince,</l>
            <l>of one like Robbin Hood.</l>
            <l>Full thirtéene yeares and something more,</l>
            <l>these outlawes lived thus:</l>
            <l>Feared of the rich, loved of the poore,</l>
            <l>a thing most marvelous.</l>
            <l>A thing unpossible to us,</l>
            <l>this story séemes to be:</l>
            <l>None dares be now so venturous,</l>
            <l>but times are chang'd we sée.</l>
            <l>We that live in these latter dayes,</l>
            <l>of civill government;</l>
            <pb facs="tcp:25113:11"/>
            <l>(If néede be) have a hundred wayes,</l>
            <l>such outlawes to prevent.</l>
            <l>In those dayes men more barbarous were,</l>
            <l>and lived lesse in awe:</l>
            <l>Now (God be thanked) people feare,</l>
            <l>more to offend the Law.</l>
            <l>No roaring Guns were then in use,</l>
            <l>they dreampt of no such thing:</l>
            <l>Our English men in fight did chuse,</l>
            <l>the gallant gray Goose wing,</l>
            <l>In which activity these men,</l>
            <l>(through practise) were so good.</l>
            <l>That in those dayes non equald them,</l>
            <l>specially Robbin Hood.</l>
            <l>So that it séemes, kéeping in Caves,</l>
            <l>in Woods and Forrests thicke:</l>
            <l>Thei'd beate a multitude with staves,</l>
            <l>their Arrowes did so pricke.</l>
            <l>And none durst neare unto them come,</l>
            <l>unlesse in courtesie:</l>
            <l>All such he bravely would send home,</l>
            <l>with mirth and Iollity.</l>
            <l>Which courtesie won him such love,</l>
            <l>as I before have told:</l>
            <l>'Twas the chéefe cause that he did prove,</l>
            <l>more prosperous than he could,</l>
            <l>Let us be thankefull for these times,</l>
            <l>Of plenty, truth, and peace:</l>
            <pb facs="tcp:25113:12"/>
            <l>And leave our great and horrid crimes,</l>
            <l>least they cause this to cease.</l>
            <l>I know there's many fained Tales</l>
            <l>of Robbin Hood and's Crew.</l>
            <l>But Chronicles which seldome fayles,</l>
            <l>reports this to be true:</l>
            <l>Let none then thinke this a lye,</l>
            <l>for if twere put to th' worst:</l>
            <l>They may the truth of all discry,</l>
